# punctuation-tracker-2.0
Remove words and leave behind punctuation, with or without spaces. Inspired by [Clive Thompson's](https://medium.com/creators-hub/what-i-learned-about-my-writing-by-seeing-only-the-punctuation-efd5334060b1) tool.

This tool is similar to Thompson's, albeit with a few changes:
a) It automatically generates charts as an output, akin to [this WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/charting-punctuation-usage-in-literary-classics/) article.
b) Instead of removing spaces, users have the option to retain spaces and represent them as --- to represent the length of each sentence.
